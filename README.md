##Why has this stopped development
I realized making this in android, would limit it to only be on android. Also I was facing a very nast OOM error,
that was lead either by a memory leak that I tried a month to fix (That may not have even existed), or the way java
could not garbage collect all of the large images I was throwing. So I decided to simply decided this was a sign to
learn unity and I did! See Here [Super Punch Legacy](https://github.com/torch2424/Punch-Legacy). However, this serves
still as a great project I am very fond of, and really shows what awesome things you can make in android studio 
(Before you reach OOM errors haha!)

##Building and testing
Clone the repo, and open in Android Studio :) These projects may have weird issues opening, since I've been doing
Android since the Eclipse days, things may need a little work to get everything up and running!
